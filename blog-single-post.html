            <p class="blog-single-paragraph"> We've all had that moment where we think "Awesome, my hair is finally the length I wanted! ...Now what?" Having 
                long hair for the first time can be an odd experience. You're hyper aware of it, it's in your face a lot, and it 
            feels like it's EVERYWHERE! But not to worry, we have some helpful tips for you to keep those flowing locks on lock.</p>
            <p class="blog-single-paragraph">First, let's talk hair-care. If you've never had long hair before, you should know that combing is going to be a 
                bit of an adventure. We recommend using a good conditioning detangler, and GOING SLOW (we cannot stress this enough).
                If you go too fast you'll quickly find out that tangles are a part of life now. Comb carefully, condition, and be 
                patient with yourself, ok? This is new, noone expects you to nail it the first time. Or the thirty-first.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-single-paragraph">Wondering how to keep things out of your eyes? Just don't want to deal with the length while you're out on a windy day?
                You can always put it up, but be aware of how you do it! Try to keep those updos a little looser. Not only will they look
                great, but you'll be putting far less stress on your hair and scalp. Also, it's important to mix up how you pull wear it when
                it's up. Any time you put your hair up it's going to cause some tension, and putting it up the same way every time can cause
                continual wear and tear. Try a mix of pony-tails, loose top-buns, and why not let your hair down every so often? You grew it,
                you earned it!
